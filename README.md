## Introduction

Welcome to your first week of work at the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). Time to get to work!

Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, we've had the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. We're hoping it will let us learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! We need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city, and that is **exactly** where you come in!

## Dataset

The dataset, along with description, can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/).

**This is also where you will be submitting your code for evaluation**. We will be using the Kaggle Leaderboard to keep track of your score. The public leaderboard uses roughly 30% of the dataset to score an AUC (Area Under Curve) metric. [You can read more about the scoring metric here](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/AreaUnderCurve).

> If you do not already have a Kaggle account, you will need to sign up on the website.  Also note that you will be submitting a "Late Submission" on Kaggle because the official competition has ended.  You can use the leaderboard to see how your results compare against roughly 1300 other data science teams!

You can submit predictions as many times as you want to Kaggle, but there is a limit of 5 submissions per day.  Be intentional with your submissions!
